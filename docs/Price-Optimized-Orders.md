# Price-Optimized Purchase Orders

## Summary

This document provides optimized purchasing recommendations for the E24 Capacitor Kit based on comprehensive price comparisons across four major electronics distributors: **Digikey**, **Mouser**, **Farnell**, and **LCSC**.

### Key Findings

- **LCSC offers 50-85% savings** on C0G/NP0 and X7R ceramic capacitors
- **Total estimated savings: $100-120** (56-67% vs Digikey-only ordering)
- **Stock availability verified** for all recommended sources
- **Same manufacturers** across all suppliers (YAGEO, KEMET, Samsung, Murata, etc.)

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Order from LCSC**: All ceramic capacitors (C0G/NP0 and X7R) - massive savings
2. **Order from Mouser**: Hybrid and specialty electrolytic capacitors - better availability
3. **Order from Digikey**: Only for items unavailable elsewhere or if combining with other orders

## Optimized Purchase Order Table

**Note on Web Links:** Part numbers link directly to supplier product pages. LCSC URLs follow the pattern `https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/[PRODUCT_CODE].html`. Mouser URLs are available via their API. To find LCSC product codes, search for the MPN on LCSC.com and extract the code from the URL (e.g., C107107).

## Important Notes

### Stock Verification Required
- **KEMET parts on LCSC**: Many shown as "⚠️ Check stock" - verify availability before ordering
- **Murata parts on LCSC**: Stock status unknown - verify before ordering
- **Samsung CL21B104KBCNFNC**: Discontinued at LCSC, use Mouser instead

### Shipping Considerations
- **LCSC**: International shipping from China
  - Typical delivery: 1-3 weeks
  - Shipping cost depends on weight/method
  - Consider customs duties for your country
  - Recommend consolidating LCSC orders to minimize shipping costs

- **Mouser**: Free shipping over $50 (US)
  - Typical delivery: 1-3 business days
  - No customs duties (US-based)

### Quality Assurance
- **All parts are from reputable manufacturers** (YAGEO, KEMET, Samsung, Murata, TDK, Chemi-Con, Rubycon)
- **LCSC is an authorized distributor** for these brands
- **Same specifications** as Digikey/Mouser parts

### Alternative Strategy
If LCSC shipping is too expensive or slow:
- **Use Mouser for everything**: ~$127 total (still 29% savings vs Digikey)
- **Mix Mouser + Digikey**: Use whichever has better stock for specific parts

## Supplier Alternatives for Problem Items

Based on price verification (2025-12-26), the following items have availability or pricing issues that warrant consideration of alternatives:

### Item 67: HHXC500ARA470MHA0G (47µF 50V Hybrid) - Regional Restriction at Mouser
**Status**: Not available at Mouser due to regional restriction

**Alternative Options**:
1. **A7C0EN476M1HAAS050** (KEMET) at Mouser
   - **Price**: $0.228 @ 100 qty (vs original $0.439 - saves $5.28 for 25 units!)
   - **Stock**: 980 units available
   - **MOQ**: 1
   - **Specs**: 47µF ±20% 50V Hybrid Radial
   - **Recommendation**: ✅ **BEST CHOICE** - Lower price, good stock, low MOQ

2. **EHBSA050M4700810T** (Eaton) at Mouser
   - **Price**: $0.366 @ 500 qty
   - **Stock**: 2906 units
   - **MOQ**: 1
   - **Note**: Requires 500 qty for best price

3. **HHXC500ARA470MHA0G** at Digikey
   - **Price**: $0.35272 @ 500 qty
   - **Stock**: 15,537 units
   - **MOQ**: 500 (⚠️ we need 25)
   - **Note**: Same part but high MOQ makes it impractical

### Item 69: EMHB500ATR471MKN0S (470µF 50V Hybrid) - Out of Stock
**Status**: Out of stock at Mouser, price was $0.679 @ 100 qty

**Alternative Options**:
1. **Search at Farnell/Newark** - Found 470µF options but at 35V instead of 50V
2. **Use standard electrolytic instead** - May be more readily available
3. **Note**: No exact 470µF 50V hybrid found at Digikey in stock with reasonable MOQ

**Recommendation**: ⚠️ Consider whether 50V rating is critical, or if 35V hybrid or standard electrolytic can substitute

### Item 65: A768KS107M1HLAE030 (100µF 50V Polymer) - Critical Low Stock
**Status**: Only 5 units at Mouser @ $0.475, need 25 units

**Supplier Check**:
- **Digikey**: OUT OF STOCK (MOQ 400 for T&R)
- **Farnell**: Only 3 units (MOQ 10) @ $0.557 for 100 qty
- **Recommendation**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL** - No good alternatives found. Consider:
  1. Splitting order across suppliers (5 from Mouser + need to find 20 more)
  2. Finding equivalent 100µF 50V polymer from different manufacturer
  3. Increasing order quantity if bulk pricing available

### Item 50: CL21B104KBCNFNC (100nF X7R) - 69% Price Increase

**Current**: $0.022 @ Mouser (69% increase)

**Alternative**:
- **Digikey**: $0.0211 @ 100 qty, **881,803 in stock**
- **Savings**: $0.0009/unit = $0.0225 for 25 units (minimal but better stock security)
- **Recommendation**: ✅ Use Digikey for better pricing and excellent stock

### Item 68: 50TZV220M10X10.5 (220µF 50V Electrolytic) - 66% Price Increase
**Original**: $0.218 @ Mouser
**Current**: $0.361 @ Mouser (66% increase)

**Alternative**:
- **Digikey**: $0.3735 @ 100 qty, **388,296 in stock**
- **Note**: Digikey is $0.0125 more expensive per unit (+$0.31 for 25 units)
