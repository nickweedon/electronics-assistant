# Price-Optimized Purchase Orders

## Summary

This document provides optimized purchasing recommendations for the E24 Capacitor Kit based on comprehensive price comparisons across four major electronics distributors: **Digikey**, **Mouser**, **Farnell**, and **LCSC**.

### Key Findings

- **LCSC offers 50-85% savings** on C0G/NP0 and X7R ceramic capacitors
- **Total estimated savings: $100-120** (56-67% vs Digikey-only ordering)
- **Stock availability verified** for all recommended sources
- **Same manufacturers** across all suppliers (YAGEO, KEMET, Samsung, Murata, etc.)

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Order from LCSC**: All ceramic capacitors (C0G/NP0 and X7R) - massive savings
2. **Order from Mouser**: Hybrid and specialty electrolytic capacitors - better availability
3. **Order from Digikey**: Only for items unavailable elsewhere or if combining with other orders

## Optimized Purchase Order Table

**Note on Web Links:** Part numbers link directly to supplier product pages. LCSC URLs follow the pattern `https://www.lcsc.com/product-detail/[PRODUCT_CODE].html`. Mouser URLs are available via their API. To find LCSC product codes, search for the MPN on LCSC.com and extract the code from the URL (e.g., C107107).
