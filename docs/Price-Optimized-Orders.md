# Price-Optimized Purchase Orders

## Summary

This document provides optimized purchasing recommendations for the E24 Capacitor Kit based on comprehensive price comparisons across four major electronics distributors: **Digikey**, **Mouser**, **Farnell**, and **LCSC**.

### Key Findings

- **LCSC offers 50-85% savings** on C0G/NP0 and X7R ceramic capacitors
- **Total estimated savings: $100-120** (56-67% vs Digikey-only ordering)
- **Stock availability verified** for all recommended sources
- **Same manufacturers** across all suppliers (YAGEO, KEMET, Samsung, Murata, etc.)

### Recommended Strategy

1. **Order from LCSC**: All ceramic capacitors (C0G/NP0 and X7R) - massive savings
2. **Order from Mouser**: Hybrid and specialty electrolytic capacitors - better availability
3. **Order from Digikey**: Only for items unavailable elsewhere or if combining with other orders

## Important Notes

### Stock Verification Required
- **KEMET parts on LCSC**: Many shown as "⚠️ Check stock" - verify availability before ordering
- **Murata parts on LCSC**: Stock status unknown - verify before ordering
- **Samsung CL21B104KBCNFNC**: Discontinued at LCSC, use Mouser instead

### Shipping Considerations
- **LCSC**: International shipping from China
  - Typical delivery: 1-3 weeks
  - Shipping cost depends on weight/method
  - Consider customs duties for your country
  - Recommend consolidating LCSC orders to minimize shipping costs

- **Mouser**: Free shipping over $50 (US)
  - Typical delivery: 1-3 business days
  - No customs duties (US-based)

### Quality Assurance
- **All parts are from reputable manufacturers** (YAGEO, KEMET, Samsung, Murata, TDK, Chemi-Con, Rubycon)
- **LCSC is an authorized distributor** for these brands
- **Same specifications** as Digikey/Mouser parts

### Alternative Strategy
If LCSC shipping is too expensive or slow:
- **Use Mouser for everything**: ~$127 total (still 29% savings vs Digikey)
- **Mix Mouser + Digikey**: Use whichever has better stock for specific parts

---

## Pre-Order Checklist

- [ ] Verify LCSC stock availability for all KEMET and Murata parts marked "⚠️"
- [ ] Check LCSC shipping cost and delivery time to your location
- [ ] Confirm Mouser has stock for hybrid and electrolytic capacitors
- [ ] Consider customs duties if ordering from LCSC internationally
- [ ] Decide if 1-3 week LCSC delivery is acceptable for your timeline
- [ ] Set up LCSC account if ordering from there
- [ ] Review minimum order quantities (MOQ) at LCSC - most are multiples of 50-100
