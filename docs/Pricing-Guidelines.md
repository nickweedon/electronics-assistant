# Pricing and Supplier Guidelines

## Electronics Supplier Priority

The **Digikey MCP server** should be the primary source and is where the lists are stored.

As secondary sources there is also:

- **Mouser** - Use the Mouser MCP server
- **Farnell** - Use the Farnell MCP server

These can also be used to compare prices and fulfill other queries when requested.

## Price Comparison Rules

When comparing or retrieving prices, **ALWAYS** follow these rules:

### 1. Match Order Quantity

**ALWAYS** ensure that the right price is selected based on the order quantity.

**DO NOT LIST** prices that do not match the quantity being ordered.

### 2. Check Minimum Order Quantity (MOQ)

**ALWAYS** check to make sure that the MOQ (minimum order quantity) for the item is less than the quantity being requested.

If the quantity levels are all greater than the amount being ordered then this means that the item cannot be ordered since the quantity being sought is below the MOQ.

### 3. Verify Stock Availability

**ALWAYS** check that the item is actually in stock.

Having to back order an item should be treated the same as it simply not being in stock.

## Summary Checklist

When presenting pricing information, verify:

- ✅ Price tier matches order quantity
- ✅ MOQ ≤ requested quantity
- ✅ Item is in stock (not backordered)
- ✅ All conditions met before recommending purchase
